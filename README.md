## This repository contains my suggested solution structure for Codeforces problems, which I have written using the C++ language.

I have decided to push all of my Codeforces problem solutions here, so that you can review them for inspiration. If you have any comments or questions about the solutions, please feel free to ask me.

## How can I find the problem statement?

You can check my Codeforces account for the problem statement, or you can search on Google using this instruction: 'Codeforces' + 'the name of the file'. Once you press enter, the problem statement will appear.

## About PDF

I have added a PDF file to this GitHub repository that explains how to approach and solve problems. The goal of this action is to provide a resource to help beginners become familiar with competitive programming and improve their problem-solving skills. The PDF contains detailed explanations and code examples, allowing users to understand how to effectively tackle problems. I hope this will be helpful to those looking to improve their proficiency in competitive programming.
