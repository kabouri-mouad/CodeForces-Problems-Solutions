# CodeForces-Problems-Solutions

## This repository contains my suggested solution structure for Codeforces problems, which I have written using the C++ language.

I have decided to push all of my Codeforces problem solutions here, so that you can review them for inspiration. If you have any comments or questions about the solutions, please feel free to ask me.

## How can I find the problem statement?

You can check my Codeforces account for the problem statement, or you can search on Google using this instruction: 'Codeforces' + 'the name of the file'. Once you press enter, the problem statement will appear.
